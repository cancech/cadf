# Overview
CADF - C++ Application Development Framework

A collection of libraries that form a framework for the purpose of developing C++ applications. Some can be used individually, others have dependencies on other portions of the framework. Each individual library will detail its own specifics accordingly. External dependencies are being avoided where possible, with the only expected external dependencies being boost_test and fakeit - both used to power the automated tests verifying framework capabilities.

This genesys of this framework was the realization that while there are many development frameworks and libraries (such as boost and Qt), none of them were explicitely doing exactly what I had wanted. Thus, I started working on a tailor made framework which would do exactly what I needed. In part this is used as a learning experience to gain a deeper understanding in areas that I have no as yet had much exposure to.
